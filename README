Pybreak is a python filetype plugin for easily toggling set_trace statements, making it more convenient to debug python scripts. The following python filetype keymappings are provided:

* <localleader>d - inserts a set_trace statement after the cursor position if
  no statements (as inserted by pybreak) are found on the current line. _If_,
  however, any set_trace statements are found at the current line, they are
  removed, and no further set_trace statements are inserted.
* <localleader>D - as <localleader>d, with the minor difference that this
  keymapping inserts the set_trace statement _at_ the cursor position.
* <localleader>da - removes _all_ set_trace statements in the active buffer
* <localleader>de - toggles set_trace (see <localleader>d), writes the
  buffer to disk, and then executes the file with the python interpreter.

If the script does not work, make sure that the file being edited is recognized as a python file (set ft? returning filetype=python).
